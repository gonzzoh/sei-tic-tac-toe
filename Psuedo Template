Draw a board
    - 3 x 3 grid
Two players, X and O
X placed in one of the squares
O placed in one of the open squares
Continue alternating placing X's and O's in the remaining squares
Once a square has a letter in it, it can't be changed and cannot have another letter added to it (square is "unavailable")
If a player connects three squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally with the same letter, that player wins and the game is over
Once game is over, no remaining squares can be filled with X or O
